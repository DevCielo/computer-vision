# Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to my **Computer Vision Projects** repository! ðŸŽ¥ðŸ“¸ This is a collection of projects I've created while learning and experimenting with computer vision concepts and techniques. The goal is to document my journey and build a portfolio of foundational and advanced projects in computer vision.

## Projects

### 1. Build Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch
- **Description:**
  - A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation built from scratch using PyTorch to understand its architecture and working.
- **Features:**
  - 2 Convolution Layers (followed by ReLU activation).
  - 2 Max Pooling Layers.
  - 3 Fully Connected Layers.
- **Purpose:**
  - To implement and train a basic CNN architecture and observe its performance on a dataset.

### 2. Build Deep Convolutional Neural Network
- **Description:**
  - An improved version of the initial CNN, this deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) incorporates additional layers to enhance its accuracy and performance. Built and trained using PyTorch.
- **Features:**
  - 4 Convolution Layers (followed by ReLU activation).
  - 2 Max Pooling Layers.
  - 3 Fully Connected Layers.
- **Improvements:**
  - The additional convolutional layers allow for deeper feature extraction, resulting in better accuracy compared to the first CNN model.
- **Purpose:**
  - To explore the impact of deeper architectures on classification accuracy and further understand how network depth affects performance.
